    <h3>Flagship Location: 123 Git Ln, Rolesville, NC</h3>
    <p>The owner of H-Thai-ML chose to open up his first restaurant in Rolesville, NC because that's the community in
      which he grew up in! The townsfolk are friendly, and always loved his cooking at the local cookout every month. So
      much so that they decided to help fund his startup restaurant business. Now we have 4 locations stretched across
      the Raleigh, NC area, and the whole city can't get enough of this amazing food!
